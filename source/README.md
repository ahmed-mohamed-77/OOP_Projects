# The Guest Management System

## Description

The **Guest Management System** is a user-friendly Python application that simplifies the process of tracking and managing guest details. It allows you to efficiently store and update guest information such as names, ages, and loyalty ranks. These ranks are dynamically calculated based on the points guests earn through various activities, ensuring that your guest list is always up-to-date.

The system automatically assigns guests to loyalty tiers such as **Platinum**, **Gold**, **Silver**, **Bronze**, or **Un-ranked**, depending on their accumulated points. Whether you're managing a VIP program, running a customer rewards system, or simply keeping tabs on guest interactions, the system provides the tools needed to accurately categorize guests and offer personalized experiences.

Additionally, you can easily review guest information by their rank, making it perfect for scenarios where personalized service or targeted promotions are essential.

## Loyalty Program

A **loyalty program** is a rewards-based system designed to encourage customers to engage with a business by offering benefits such as discounts, exclusive offers, or special services. Customers accumulate points through their interactions, which can be redeemed for rewards or used to elevate their status within the program. Higher-ranked members often enjoy additional perks, providing an incentive for continued participation.
